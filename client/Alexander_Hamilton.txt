impoverished, in squalor,
grow up to be a hero and a scholar?
JOHN LAURENS
The ten-dollar founding father without a
father
got a lot farther by working a lot harder,
by being a lot smarter,
by being a self-starter,
by fourteen, they placed him in charge of a
trading charter.
THOMAS JEFFERSON
And every day while slaves were being
slaughtered and carted
away across the waves, he struggled and kept
his guard up.
Inside, he was longing for something to be
a part of,
the brother was ready to beg, steal, borrow
or barter.
JAMES MADISON
Then a hurricane came, and devastation
reigned,
our man saw his future drip, dripping down
the drain,
put a pencil to his temple, connected it to
his brain,
and he wrote his first refrain, a testament
to his pain.
BURR
Well, the word got around, they said, “This
kid is insane, man”
took up a collection just to send him to the
mainland.
“Get your education, don’t forget from whence
you came, and
the world is gonna know your name. What’s
your name, man?”
ALEXANDER HAMILTON

My name is Alexander Hamilton.
And there’s a million things I haven’t done,
but just you wait, just you wait . . .
ELIZA HAMILTON

GEORGE
WASHINGTON

something new inside,
a voice saying,
“You gotta fend for
yourself.”
COMPANY
“Alex,
he started retreatin’
and readin’ every
treatise on the shelf.
you gotta fend for
yourself.”
BURR
There would have
been nothin’ left
to do
for someone less
astute,
he woulda been dead
or destitute
without a cent of
restitution,
started workin’,
clerkin’ for his late
mother’s landlord,
tradin’ sugar cane
and rum and all the
things he can’t afford
scammin’ for every
book he can get his
hands on,
COMPANY
Scammin’
plannin’ for the
future see him now as
he stands on Plannin’

headed for a new
land,

be a new man.
